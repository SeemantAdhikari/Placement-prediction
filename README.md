# 🎓 Placement Prediction using Perceptron

This project builds a simple **binary classification model** using a **Perceptron** to predict whether a student is placed or not based on their **CGPA** and **IQ**.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:
- `cgpa`: Cumulative Grade Point Average  
- `iq`: Intelligence Quotient  
- `placement`: 1 (Placed) or 0 (Not Placed)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

This project is built and tested in **Google Colab**.

1. Open `Perceptron.ipynb` in Colab  
2. Upload the CSV dataset when prompted  
3. Run all cells to train the model and visualize the decision boundary

---

## 📊 Results

- Perceptron model trained using two input features  
- Feature scaling applied using `StandardScaler`  
- Decision boundary plotted using `mlxtend`  
- Visual distinction achieved between placed and non-placed students  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)  
- Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization  
- `mlxtend` for decision boundary plotting
